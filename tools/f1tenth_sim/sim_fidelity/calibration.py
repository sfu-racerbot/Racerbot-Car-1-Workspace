"""This car's physical parameters, each tagged with where it came from.

The point of this module is honesty about what is known. Stock F1TENTH Gym
ships one parameter set describing *a* small car; almost none of it was ever
checked against the vehicle in this workshop. Rather than silently inheriting
those numbers, every value here carries a :class:`Provenance` saying whether it
was measured on this car, derived from this car's committed configs, taken from
a datasheet for a part actually fitted, estimated from physics, or simply
inherited from upstream.

``python3 -m sim_fidelity.calibration`` prints the table, worst provenance
first. Anything still marked ``STOCK`` is a number nobody has justified.

Filling in a measurement means editing one line here. See
``docs/sim-fidelity-audit.md`` R1 for the procedures.
